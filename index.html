									<h1>Freeem</h1>
									<p>
										Freeem is a startup focused on gaining time. The project we are developing right now is an application to digitalize waiting lines.
										We are a team of 3 students and are currently hard working on it. Do not hesitate to contact me if you may be interested in virtualizing your
										waiting lines.

									<h1>School project I</h1>
									<p>
										In 2020, during the second trimester of my studies, I had to create, with 3 other students, a robot that must follow a line.
										We started to understand how to code the integrated boards, how to control the wheels and the motion or how
										to communicate between the different parts of the robot.<br/>
										Unfortunately, COVID-19 made it impossible to finish the robot. Instead we had to work on a simulation. But beyond that,
										we had the opportunity to play with the robot and discover it.

									<h1>School project II</h1>
									<p>
										In 2021, we had to make a drawing application. We learned to use Angular, Express and MongoDB. And moreover, we learned to work in a team.
										That was some sort of a marathon, we had to be organized, aware of what everyone was doing and respect schedules. It was satisfying to work on
										it and to do as most as we could to make the project as good as possible.<br/>
										Obviously, we worked on other classes at the same time, so we did not have as much time as we wanted to make it somewhat perfect, so there are
										some bugs and UX and UI problems. But anyway, this was very interesting to do.

									<h1>Rounded Rocky Walls</h1>
									<p>
										This is the first big ambitious game I made. I made it from scratch: I created my game engine based on LWJGL (in Java) and used it
										to create the game. I did not make the musics though. I made it in 2016. I really like the game and the concept. I swear I will remake it
										someday. Make it even more juicy and "arcade", get compositors and all to make the best thing possible. Just for the sake of it!

									<h1>Hurry Up!</h1>
									<p>
										I made this game &mdash; and 8 other ones &mdash; for the Ludum Dare. This is a game jam where you have 48 hours to make a game.
										This game is quite particular to me because this is, I think, the best one. The main reason for that is because I continue to
										work on it after the jam itself. Plus, it is quite meta and I like that. I think it's fun.

									<h1>Falling Forms</h1>
									<p>
										This game has a special place in my heart. I really like it, but I never finished it. It lacks something, the game's too simple to my taste.
										It looks like a big mini-game in a way. But anyway, I think it is very cool, the bosses are neat and their attacks are visually powerful.
										I note it somewhere: "Finish this game once and for all.". There.

									<h1>Runner out of power</h1>
									<p>
										Another game made for the Ludum Dare. This one is not that special. The only reason I dedicate a section for it is that because I
										made an AI that learns to play this game. Unfortunately, I lost my datas so I can't show you what it was about, but here is the thing:
										I made a genetic algorythm to teach the AI to play. After that, I continued to create AI that learns to play to games, and I think that's
										fun.

										Finally, here are all my other games. It's been so long that I did not make more games, but I really want to get back to it.

									<h1>Aux couleurs du tissu</h1>
									<p>
										Again for the cinema class, for my last year, I had to make, with two of my friends, a movie. It was meant to be the last thing
										we do, so we wanted to do something big. Moreover, few months later, I went to the Canada, so yeah, we wanted to create something
										big, finally. We decided to make an animated movie. We worked for an entire year on our spare time and here is the result. Well, it obviously
										has problems, but we are really proud of it.<br />
										I personally loved working with my friends, with a team. It was so rewarding to work together, to see kind of a synergy. I do not think
										we were that efficient, but in the end, both the travel and the product are unforgettable.

									<h1>Shorts</h1>
									<p>
										In 2015, we were already into making films. Playing with friends and making fun things together is cool, isn't it? So we made 4 live shorts,
										all 4 in the same universe. The acting is awful and the story itself is quite weird, but here is the thing: we had fun making this! I
										can not be not proud of this, even if it is an awkward thing to watch ahah.
